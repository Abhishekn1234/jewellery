Create: Users can add new products to the database. Each product includes:

Product Name

Description

Price

Category (Dropdown selection of available categories)

Image (Uploaded image is resized to 500x500px before saving to ensure consistency)

Read: Users can view the list of products, which is displayed using DataTables. Features include:

Server-side pagination: Only a limited number of products are shown at a time, improving performance.

Search: Users can search products by name, category, or price.

Sorting: Columns can be sorted (by name, price, etc.).

Column visibility: Users can toggle visibility for different product columns.

Update: Users can edit product details (e.g., name, description, price, category, and image).

Delete: Users can delete products from the list.

3. Category Management
Categories: Products are organized by categories. When creating or editing a product, users can select a category from a dropdown list.

Categories are managed in the backend, and users can associate products with the appropriate categories.

4. Server-Side Pagination and Search Logic
Server-Side Pagination: The product list is fetched using AJAX, implementing server-side pagination. Only a limited number of products are loaded per page to improve performance.

Search: The system supports searching products based on different parameters, such as:

Product Name

Category

Price

The search functionality is powered by server-side logic, ensuring only matching products are returned from the server.

5. Product Image Upload and Resize
Users can upload images for each product. The system uses CodeIgniterâ€™s Image Manipulation Library to resize the uploaded images to a maximum width and height of 500px while maintaining the aspect ratio.
